## 📚 Learning Journey  

I didn’t know coding before, so it took me **33 days to learn SwiftUI from scratch**.  
With the help of **ChatGPT**, I was able to grab code, assemble it, and slowly understand how it works.  

👉 But this project is not just about copy-paste. To build it, you need to **understand the concepts** behind MVVM, Firebase, and SwiftUI.  
For a CS student, this app could be done in about **15 days with 6 hours of focus per day**, though it depends on the person.  

At this stage, I’d say I’m about **60% job-ready**.  
I still struggle with:  
- 🔒 Firestore security rules  
- 💾 Advanced offline persistence  
- 📲 Push notifications  

But I continue to improve step by step.
